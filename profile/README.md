# DoDays

The family activity and events market is fragmented and broken through legacy processes and a real lack of inspiration.

DoDays helps these providers advertise, sell and do more of what they love, delivering unforgettable experiences, whilst inspiring and motivating families to make today a DoDay!

We're an advertising and booking platform helping activity and event providers, such as swim schools and dance classes, reach new heights.

We empower providers to do more of what they love, and less of the boring stuff, enabling them to deliver unforgettable experiences to their customers.

Our core mission is to inspire and enrich family and community life through making it easy to discover all the wonderful things there is to do, locally...and beyond!
